Summary of this app-

You're building BitLinks, a URL shortener app using Next.js. This app will allow users to shorten long URLs into compact, shareable links. It will likely feature instant redirection, analytics tracking, and possibly custom aliases for personalized links.

With Next.js, you'll benefit from server-side rendering (SSR), API routes for database operations (MongoDB), and a smooth user experience. Your project can also integrate authentication (NextAuth.js) and a dashboard for managing shortened links. ðŸš€ Let me know if you want help with specific features!
